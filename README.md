# Job Application Flow API

An automated multi-agent system for job search and application generation, deployed as a REST API on HuggingFace Spaces. This system searches for relevant job postings and automatically generates customized CVs and motivation letters for each position.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Trigger the workflow
curl -X POST https://your-space.hf.space/api/trigger

# Response:
{
  "job_id": "abc-123-def-456",
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Workflow has been queued and will start shortly"
}

# Check status
curl https://your-space.hf.space/api/status/abc-123-def-456

# Get results
curl https://your-space.hf.space/api/results/abc-123-def-456
```

## Limitations

- Job search is **simulated** (returns realistic but generated postings)
- Storage is **ephemeral** on HuggingFace Spaces (results returned via API)
- Job status stored **in-memory** (lost on restart)
